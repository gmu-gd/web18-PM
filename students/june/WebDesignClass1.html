			<li>Not all sandwhiches are hotdogs, but a hotdog is indeed a class of sandwhich. Is similar to the whole 'rectangle' and 'square' thing.</li><br>
			<li>Poptarts are simply not ravioli.</li><br>
			<li>I think the tast of milk first for my cereal is a lot better but realistically forget about said preference, because life, so I'm use to cereal first.</li><br>
			<li>Virginia, as a whole</li><br>
			<li>Oda is the Goat, but I looking at surrealistic work and appreciate a lot of large character designs. I think people who combine multiple mediums (i.e. comics being where writing meets visual art) are the most interesting. </li><br>
			<li>Survivor (catch me on there one day)</li><br>
			<li>I like shooting videos for YouTube, watching character design and pyschology videos, and also being able to connect with people by learning their stories.</li><br>
			<li>I played football since I was five, but due to various injuries I stopped and now I just do basketball for fun.</li><br>
			<li>Black, but I've recently been feeling Orange and Lavender.</li><br>
			<li>I think being able know what is actually possible with html and website design would be helpful so when I do things like making a portfollio, I can captilize or have someone else work on showcasing features that aren't normally done in an artistic way.</li><br>
