        <h4>E5. Programmer and Computer</h4>
        <p><strong>Part 1 - The Programmer</strong> Create a simple drawing in Illustrator in 2 minutes. Once you are finished, write a very precise set of instructions that will be executed by a computer. A classmate will be the computer and the result of that person following your program should result in an exact copy of your drawing. You cannot use images or verbal communications to help explain your instructions, only written words. You also cannot let the computer see what the final drawing should look like.</p>
        <p>Upload the instructions to your website but do not upload the drawing yet.</p>
        <p><strong>Part 2 - The Computer</strong> Using a classmates program, execute those instructions to recreate the drawing. Do not assume instructions, follow what is written as closely as you can. Send the final drawing back to the programmer. Do this step for two different programs.</p>
        <p><strong>Part 3 - Upload</strong> Once you have two drawings back from the two different computers, upload the two drawings along with your original to the same page as the instructions.</p>
        <p><strong>Brief History Lesson</strong> A computer was actually a job description held by many humans at one point in time, especially during WWII, where computers (mostly women) were hired to do calculation and computation on vast quantities of numbers. Also, Ada Lovelace (December 10, 1815&ndash;November 17, 1852), the daughter of poet Lord Byron, published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by a machine and is regarded as the first computer programmer. Furthermore, the term "debugging" originated from the actions of programmer Grace Hopper (December 9, 1906&ndash;January 1, 1992), who took a literal moth out of military computer. In today's male-dominated tech fields, it's important recognize the roots of computation and programming.</p>

        <h4>P1. Single Serve</h4>
        <p>A single serve website is comprised of a single page that only does one thing. You will come up with a concept and design for a single serve website and then build the website. The concept can be simple or complex but the site must only be a single page and serve a single function. The URL of the site should help explain the concept and the content should help reinforce the URL. If you need a place to look at single serve websites go <a href="https://theuselessweb.com/">here</a>. That website is a single serve website that takes you to other single serve websites.</p>

        <h4>E3. Patterns</h4>
        <p>Using what you have learned so far, make some patterns with html. You can use divs or type to make these patterns. You should make five different patterns.</p>

        <h4>E2. Floats</h4>
        <p>Recreate the layouts in the E2 PDF on Blackboard with HTML using divs and floats. Remember that you might need to contain some divs inside other divs to get the layouts to work.</p>

        <h4>E1. seven-principles.txt</h4>
        <p>Copy and paste the text from the source file to your HTML file. Mark up the document by keeping in mind which HTML tags are appropriate for which segments of content. Using your new knowledge of some simple CSS styling properties, style the Carl Dair content. Keep in mind web font implementation and font properties. Play with color and scale, and experiment to get familiar with this new language.</p>
