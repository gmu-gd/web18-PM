        <h4>P3. Responsive Single Page</h4>
        <p>Design a responsive single page site. The site should have a mobile version (320px&ndash;768px), tablet version (768px&ndash;1024px), small desktop version (1024px&ndash;2000px), and large desktop version (2000px+). The content of the site is up to you but you should have at least text, images, and links to external sites. The digital versions should be built in Sketch, Illustrator, or XD and the final will be coded by you.</p>
        <p>Some ideas could be a site for a current issue, a site re-presenting a longform article, or a site acting as a type specimen.</p>

        <h4>E9. Wireframes</h4>
        <p>Create two wireframes for the home page of the site you used for your site map. The first wireframe should be done on Sketch, Illustrator, or XD and use the widest version of the site you can see. The second wireframe should be done with pen/pencil and paper and use the mobile version of the site.</p>
        <p>Upload an image of both wireframes to your site.</p>
        <ul>

        <h4>E8. Type on Screen</h4>
        <p>Select a book from <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/browse/scores/top">this list</a>. Using the title, author, chapter title, and first paragraph, make 10 different layouts. Each layout should be different and focus on contrast, heirarchy, and positioning. Design some pages with one typeface and some pages with multiple typefaces. Try symmetrical and asymmetrical layouts and use color, size, weight, style and other typographic concepts to create a well designed, readable page.</p>
        <p>Upload each layout to your site.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>October 4</strong> Start</li>
          <li><strong>October 11</strong> Due</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h4>E7. Site Maps</h4>
        <p>Create a site map showing the structure and organization of a website. Also include who you think the intended audience is and what the main action or actions the site is hoping a user to accomplish. The site needs to be more than a few pages. It should multiple levels of information across multiple pages. You can create your sitemap in any software you choose but it needs to be  done digitally. My recommendation would be to use Illustrator.</p>
        <p>Upload your final site map to your site and include a link to the website you made the site map for.</p>

        <h4>P2. Linking Narratives</h4>
        <p>The structure of a website is as equally important as the design of a website. Getting from page X to page Y needs to be intuitive and simple. This structure also needs to be reflected on the back end. Create a site that takes the user through a narrative using text, links, and multiple pages.</p>
        <p><strong>Part 1 - Choose the Text</strong> Pick a text that can be broken into parts. The text can be something straight forward like a news article or more abstract like a poem. The text needs to be long enough to be broken into at least 10 pages.</p>
        <p><strong>Part 2 - Build the Site</strong> Now weave these distinct units together using many html pages and links. Allow for user choice, branching structures, loops, etc. The linking does not have to follow a linear sequence. See if you can produce new readings and ways of traversing your composition. When linking different parts of the composition together, think of the meaning of each link. Are they linking between similar content? Similar characters? Similar actions? Are the meaning of links consistent across all of your pages? Do you have different types of links? How could these different types of links be indicated? Remember that you cannot add words to the text, the links you create must exist in the original words.</p>
        <p>You may include additional materials in the webpages if they add meaning to your sequences of links.</p>

        <h4>E6. Organization and Naming</h4>
        <p>File naming and organization are important parts of making sure your files are easy to find both visually and while writing links. On Blackboard there is a simple site with a terrible file structure. Rename these files something clear and simple and then organize them into a nice folder structure. The site has a main page and then 3 sub pages for an about page, a menus page, and a gallery page.</p>
        <p>Once you have organized and renamed the files, take a screenshot of the new structure and post it to your site. If you cannot get a view where all the files and folders are shown in one folder, take multiple screenshots or position multiple folders on the screen to show the structure.</p>

        <h4>E5. Programmer and Computer</h4>
        <p><strong>Part 1 - The Programmer</strong> Create a simple drawing in Illustrator in 2 minutes. Once you are finished, write a very precise set of instructions that will be executed by a computer. A classmate will be the computer and the result of that person following your program should result in an exact copy of your drawing. You cannot use images or verbal communications to help explain your instructions, only written words. You also cannot let the computer see what the final drawing should look like.</p>
        <p>Upload the instructions to your website but do not upload the drawing yet.</p>
        <p><strong>Part 2 - The Computer</strong> Using a classmates program, execute those instructions to recreate the drawing. Do not assume instructions, follow what is written as closely as you can. Send the final drawing back to the programmer. Do this step for two different programs.</p>
        <p><strong>Part 3 - Upload</strong> Once you have two drawings back from the two different computers, upload the two drawings along with your original to the same page as the instructions.</p>
        <p><strong>Brief History Lesson</strong> A computer was actually a job description held by many humans at one point in time, especially during WWII, where computers (mostly women) were hired to do calculation and computation on vast quantities of numbers. Also, Ada Lovelace (December 10, 1815&ndash;November 17, 1852), the daughter of poet Lord Byron, published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by a machine and is regarded as the first computer programmer. Furthermore, the term "debugging" originated from the actions of programmer Grace Hopper (December 9, 1906&ndash;January 1, 1992), who took a literal moth out of military computer. In today's male-dominated tech fields, it's important recognize the roots of computation and programming.</p>

        <h4>P1. Single Serve</h4>
        <p>A single serve website is comprised of a single page that only does one thing. You will come up with a concept and design for a single serve website and then build the website. The concept can be simple or complex but the site must only be a single page and serve a single function. The URL of the site should help explain the concept and the content should help reinforce the URL. If you need a place to look at single serve websites go <a href="https://theuselessweb.com/">here</a>. That website is a single serve website that takes you to other single serve websites.</p>

        <h4>E2. Floats</h4>
        <p>Recreate the layouts in the E2 PDF on Blackboard with HTML using divs and floats. Remember that you might need to contain some divs inside other divs to get the layouts to work.</p>

        <p>Copy and paste the text from the source file to your HTML file. Mark up the document by keeping in mind which HTML tags are appropriate for which segments of content. Using your new knowledge of some simple CSS styling properties, style the Carl Dair content. Keep in mind web font implementation and font properties. Play with color and scale, and experiment to get familiar with this new language.</p>
